yelp graph preprocessing

create a file called df_YelpZip_comp.csv that contains the following information:
['idx', 'prod_id', 'rating', 'date', 'review', 'label'] 

create a 'graphs/' directory - DO NOT SAVE THIS TO GIT REPO AS THIS WILL BE A HUGE FILE IF YOUR SAMPLE SIZE IS LARGE

run preprocessing.py
